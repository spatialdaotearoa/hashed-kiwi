# Mapping between index names (currently the name of input files) and their
# fields. In turn, the fields are given as external-name: internal-name pairs
# to facilitate both a clean API and internal code standardisation.
# Private fields can be given with a _ prefix.
#   _allow_multiple causes the API to treat the result as non-exclusive (e.g. a
#   point can have multiple school zones but only one postcode).
